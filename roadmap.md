# Roadmap for Drone Weather Application

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Planning
### Duration: 1-2 Weeks
1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Identify core features (e.g., weather updates, flight recommendations).
   - Choose APIs for weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack, AerisWeather).
   - Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Set up a Python Flask environment.
   - Install necessary libraries (Flask, requests, Jinja2 for templating).
   - Create a Git repository for version control.

3. **Basic Flask App Structure**
   - Create a folder structure:
     ```
     /project
       /static (for CSS, JS, images)
       /templates (for HTML)
       app.py (Flask app)
     ```
   - Set up Flask routes for basic navigation (e.g., `/`, `/weather`).

## Phase 2: Weather Data Integration
### Duration: 2-3 Weeks
1. **Integrate Weather API**
   - Use Pythonâ€™s `requests` library to fetch weather data.
   - Parse JSON responses to extract drone-specific parameters (e.g., wind speed, precipitation).

2. **Backend Logic**
   - Add a route to handle API calls and process weather data.
   - Develop logic to assess flight safety based on weather thresholds.

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Create an HTML dashboard to display weather data using Jinja2 templates.
   - Style the dashboard with CSS for a clean, responsive layout.

4. **JavaScript for Real-Time Updates**
   - Use AJAX or Fetch API to make periodic requests to update weather data.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
### Duration: 4-6 Weeks
1. **Dynamic Weather Map Integration**
   - Use JavaScript libraries like Leaflet.js or Google Maps API to display weather overlays.
   - Plot real-time weather data (e.g., wind speed, precipitation).

2. **Customizable Thresholds**
   - Add a settings page to allow users to define safe flight conditions.
   - Save preferences in a database (SQLite or PostgreSQL).

3. **Notifications and Alerts**
   - Implement Flask-SocketIO for real-time notifications.
   - Send alerts if weather conditions change (e.g., wind exceeds thresholds).

4. **Flight Time Predictions**
   - Add logic to recommend optimal flight windows based on forecast data.

---

## Phase 4: User Experience and Optimization
### Duration: 3-4 Weeks
1. **Responsive UI/UX**
   - Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS for a polished, mobile-friendly design.
   - Test UI across devices and browsers.

2. **Offline Functionality**
   - Implement caching of weather data for offline access using Service Workers.

3. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Integrate D3.js or Chart.js for visualizing weather trends and forecasts.
   - Add toggles for different data layers (e.g., wind, temperature, precipitation).

4. **User Feedback and Iteration**
   - Collect feedback from early users and prioritize feature improvements.
   - Optimize performance and fix any bugs.

---

## Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance
### Duration: Ongoing
1. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the application using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Implement logging and monitoring to track app performance and errors.
   - Regularly update the app with new features and bug fixes.

3. **Scalability**
   - Prepare for increased user load by optimizing backend and database queries.
   - Implement caching and load balancing if necessary.
